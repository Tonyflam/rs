## 🎬 SCRIPT

### **[0:00–0:08] HOOK + HERO** *(8 sec)*
**Show:** Landing page hero section with the 4 stat cards + live market ticker  
**Say:**  
> "This is Aegis Protocol — an AI-powered autonomous DeFi guardian on BNB Chain. It monitors your positions 24/7, detects threats, and executes protection — all on-chain."

---

### **[0:08–0:18] LIVE MARKET DATA** *(10 sec)*
**Show:** Scroll down to the "AI Intelligence Engine" section. Point out the live BNB price, 24h change, volume, and PancakeSwap DEX cross-verification panel.  
**Say:**  
> "Everything here is live. Real BNB price from CoinGecko, cross-verified against PancakeSwap V2 on-chain. The AI detects price divergence between sources — if delta exceeds 1%, it flags oracle manipulation."

---

### **[0:18–0:30] AGENT SIMULATION** *(12 sec)*
**Show:** Scroll to the "Live Agent Simulation" section. Click the play ▶ button and let it run through 2-3 phases.  
**Say:**  
> "Here's the agent loop in action — observe, analyze, reason, verify, decide, execute. This is the exact same 30-second cycle the agent runs autonomously. It uses live market data and logs every decision on-chain."

---

### **[0:30–0:42] ON-CHAIN PROOF** *(12 sec)*  
**Show:** Scroll to "Deployed & Verified On-Chain" section. Show the 3 contract cards, then the TX evidence table. Click one TX hash to open BSCScan.  
**Say:**  
> "Three contracts deployed on BSC Testnet — Registry, Vault, and Decision Logger — all Sourcify-verified. Here are 13 real transactions showing the full threat lifecycle: from normal monitoring through threat detection to autonomous stop-loss execution. Every hash is clickable and verifiable on BSCScan."

---

### **[0:42–0:52] TABS — REAL DATA** *(10 sec)*
**Show:** Scroll back up to the tabs. Click **"Agent Info"** tab — show the agent's on-chain identity, tier, reputation. Then click **"Overview"** — show the risk bars and protocol stats.  
**Say:**  
> "All dashboard data comes from the BSC Testnet RPC — no fake numbers. The agent is registered as an ERC-721 NFT with on-chain reputation scoring and performance metrics."

---

### **[0:52–1:00] CLOSE** *(8 sec)*
**Show:** Scroll to footer showing GitHub link, contract links.  
**Say:**  
> "Aegis Protocol — fully deployed, verified, and autonomous. 54 Solidity tests passing, 1,300 lines of contract code, LLM + heuristic AI engine. Built for the Good Vibes Only hackathon. Thanks for watching."

## ✅ PRE-RECORD CHECKLIST
- [ ] Site loaded, live data flowing (green "On-Chain (Read)" badge in navbar)
- [ ] Live market ticker shows real BNB price (not $0)
- [ ] Browser zoom at 90% for better visibility
- [ ] No wallet connected (shows public RPC data)
- [ ] Dark mode / dark browser theme
- [ ] Close all other tabs
- [ ] Practice the script once before recording
- [ ] Keep energy high but pace calm — you have 60 seconds

## 💡 TIPS
- Don't connect a wallet — the judges will see the same public RPC view
- The live data proves it's not static screenshots
- Click a BSCScan TX link as the "mic-drop moment"
- If a section shows "0" values, that's honest — it means no mock inflation
